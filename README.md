Damnatio Ad Gladium, death by gladiator, was one of the forms of Roman capital punishment. All things considered, it’s a terrible way to die. But no more gruesome than most forms of modern capital punishment I suppose. I was thinking about this as I was attempting to update the game of “Hangman” for Latin learning. So I figured Damnatio ad gladium to be slightly less alarming than Damnatio ad bestias (and I certainly could not use crucifixion!).

This is a simple hangman game in CSS and JavaScript, (try the game HERE) from the Javascript learning site Coding Nepal. I added Latin vocabulary from open-source textbook sources (below), added support for English hints to make this more of a learning application than a guessing game, added new artwork, and wrote instruction text. I am contributing all the source code I develop to further support the ecosystems of both the Lingua Latina Legenda (the open-source beginner Latin textbook), and the Open Greek and Latin Project, which aims to collect and publish EVERY Greek and Latin piece of text available. Adding fun learning games and colorful study aids to these incredible resources will help bring more people the joy that is learning Latin!

Improvement Punch List:

— Add account creation and management so a teacher can create specific vocabulary lessons;

— Span incorrect guesses across words (for example 6 incorrect guesses per 10 words which reinforces this as a language learning app and less of a guessing game);

— Better artwork!
