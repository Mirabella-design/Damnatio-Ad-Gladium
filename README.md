Damnatio Ad Gladium, death by gladiator, was one of the forms of Roman capital punishment. All things considered, it’s a terrible way to die. But no more gruesome than most forms of modern capital punishment I suppose. I was thinking about this as I was attempting to update the game of “Hangman” for Latin learning. So I figured Damnatio ad gladium to be slightly less alarming than Damnatio ad bestias (and I certainly could not use crucifixion!).

This is a simple hangman game in CSS and JavaScript, (try the game (https://mirabella.marub.io/Damnatioadgladium/)) from the Javascript learning site Coding Nepal. I added Latin vocabulary from open-source textbook sources (below), added support for English hints to make this more of a learning application than a guessing game, added new artwork, and wrote instruction text. Hoping to help more people discover the joy that is learning Latin!

Improvement Punch List:

— Add account creation and management so a teacher can create specific vocabulary lessons;

— Span incorrect guesses across words (for example 6 incorrect guesses per 10 words which reinforces this as a language learning app and less of a guessing game);

— Better artwork!
